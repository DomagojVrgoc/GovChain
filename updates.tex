It seems counterintuitive at first to use an established, immutable blockchain in order to commit to data that is subject to change often. It is yet a principal requirement of governments for data to be updated, given the complex architecture of hierarchies and the nature of the information the documents may contain. Documents collecting signatures may change daily, spreadsheets may be corrected for errors, and agendas of public projects may be filled with more details as the time passes. The basic solution given above with a small tweak actually allows to perform this. \francisco{continue here... about the leafs of daily trees: $h_1,h_2,(h_3:h_3'), h_4$ means that $h_1,h_2,h_4$ are hashes of new documents and $h_3$ is about to be updated by $h_3'$. So guards here should check that the last element on the life of $d_3$ is indeed $h_3$ (i.e. that $h_3$ is present in a previous Merkle tree base, and possibly that it has not been updated before, else update the update).}
